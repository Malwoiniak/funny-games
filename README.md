## General info
**guess_the_number:** Asks the user to guess the number from 1 to 100. Allows 5 attempts. 

And then you die.

**portugifiy:** Turns the user's input name into Portuguese name of noble origin. 

Done to practice Python as a gift-joke for my expat collegues to help them 'blend in' in Portugal (also to mock off national tendency of names being very long).

## Technologies
* Python 3.7

## Status
Project _in progress_, new simple funny games will be added every now and then.
