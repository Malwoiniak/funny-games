# funny-games
First little games ever. Created to play around with Python.

guess_the_number: Asks the user to guess the number from 1 to 100. Allows 5 attempts. 

And then you die.

portugifier: Turns the user's input name into Portuguese name of noble origin. 

Done to practice Python as a gift-joke for my expat collegues to help them 'blend in' in Portugal (also to mock off national tendency of names being very long).
